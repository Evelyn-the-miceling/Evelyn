Option 1:
1. Using CBT, split each group by gender, stem/non-stem and CGPA/
Limitation: Return 8 leaf node, which is odd and had to implement to select 5 ppl from the category
            Classified students are separated unevenly into the leaf nodes, hence lead to uneven selection of students
            CBT is good for classification, not sorting
        
Option 2: 
1. Find the mean of CGPA of one tutorial group
2. Find the ratio of the different classification of students (gender, school)
3. Set the range of acceptable ratio of students and mean for CGPA for students.
4. Random grouping of the students into the groups.
5. Ensure that each criteria is met for each group.
