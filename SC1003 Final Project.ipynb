    "### **3. Allocate the students within a tutorial group into subgroups based on gender and CGPA diversity.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Because allocating students into subgroups to ensure school, gender, and CGPA diversity is very complex, in this step we will only allocate students into subgroups of 5 students to ensure **gender** and **CGPA** diversity, then we will swap students in different groups to ensure school diversity later\n",
    "\n",
    "We will do this in **9** steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1:** Split the list of students in a tutorial group into 2 groups containing only Male and Female students, then create 2 new male and female lists with their **CGPA** in descending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2:** Calculate the ratio of male:female students in a tutorial group. We calculate this ratio to find out about any tutorial group that is too skewered towards one gender. For groups of 5 students, the most gender-diverse type of group is 2 male - 3 female or 3 male - 2 female. So in case one gender in the tutorial group does not have at least **20** people, we must accept some groups with 1 male - 4 female or 4 male - 1 female. This corresponds to the ratio of male:female students to be less than **2/3** or larger than **3/2**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3:** After finding the ratio of male:female students in a tutorial group, if the ratio is less than **2/3** or larger than **3/2**, we will find the amount of groups that are 1 male - 4 female if the male:female ratio is less than **2/3** or the number of groups that are 4 male - 1 female if the male:female ratio is more than **3/2**. We do this by solving the matrix equation below:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "    2 & 1 \\\\\n",
    "    3 & 4\n",

    "    x \\\\\n",
    "    y\n",
    "    \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the equation above:\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - $m$ is the number of groups with a 3-2 member composition. \\\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - $n$ is the number of groups with a 4-1 member composition. \\\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - $x$ is the number of members having the minority gender. \\\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - $y$ is the number of members having the majority gender.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solving the matrix equation gives us $m = \\frac{4x - y}{5}$, $n = \\frac{-3x + 2y}{5}$. \\\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combining with $m + n = 10$ and $x + y = 50$ gives us:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    m = x - 10 \\\\\n",
    "    n = 20 - x\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4:** Create 10 groups of 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We pick four students first. There will be **3** types of 4-people groups in our sorting:\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 2 male - 2 female (for any type of group) \\\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 1 male - 3 female (for female-majority tutorial groups) \\\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 3 male - 1 female (for male-majority tutorial groups) \n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can ensure that these groups of 4 have a mix of high cgpa and low cgpa by popping from the beginning and the end of the sorted male and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;female lists. \n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why we do this is by the time we have made 10 groups, we can allocate the remaining students into groups so that the gender diversity &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is most optimised (i.e. the last students will make the group gender dynamics 2-3 or 1-4)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 5:** Create an unassigned students list of the unassigned male and female students by merging the sorted male and female list together. Then we create a new list that sorts the students by descending CGPA.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 6:** Sort the allocated 4 people groups in ascending order by the group's average CGPA.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 7:** Allocate the final members of the group into the groups of 4 by rainbow-matching the 4 people group with the highest average CGPA and the student with lowest CGPA in the unassigned student list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 8:** In case of any student is still unassigned and still remains in the unassigned list (although it should be empty), we make them into one final group and append it into our list of subgroups. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 9:** Return the allocated groups."
